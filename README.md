Diffusion Model Image Steganography(CRoSS) on cpu.

You need to download "E:\huggingface\stable-diffusion-v1-5" model from huggingface. You can change the path according to your own preferences. I also output the intermediate result (noisy image).

There are some examples that I have run in "output".
